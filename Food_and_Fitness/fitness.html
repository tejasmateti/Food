                Fitness is defined as the ability of the body to carry out various types of daily activities without feeling tired. Physical fitness is measured on the basis of some devices, and many scientific tests, 
                and then compared to the ideal level of fitness, and determined the ability of the individual, and fitness efficiency. Fitness is divided into two parts: general fitness, which refers to health and well-being, and special fitness, 
                which relates to a particular type of exercise.Good fitness can be obtained by getting proper nutrition and taking enough breaks.
                Elements of fitness are all the components or characteristics that play an important and significant role in learning the exercise techniques and achieving sound health (such as strength, speed, elongation, agility, flexibility ..... etc)
                and all the qualities that result from the merger of two or more of them.Determining the elements of physical fitness varied from school to school and from one scientist to another according to their views, but most of them agreed on some 
                basic fitness elements, and we have addressed some of them here.Unfortunately, finding the time to work out or to learn a new exercise regimen can be challenging. In fact, a research done by Bodybuilding.com revealed that almost 75% of people who set keeping fit as their New Year’s resolution tend to quit before they see results. The main reason people cannot follow through and accomplish their resolutions is that they become discouraged because they’re doing it alone. They lack the support network necessary to achieve this important goal.How important is food in fitness?
                Proper nutrition is imperative to maximize athletic performance. Without enough carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, athletes may feel sluggish and fatigued during a workout or ravenously hungry. Athletes may also need to focus on specific vitamins and minerals for fitness performance, such as iron, vitamin D, and zinc <br><br>

                There are many ways to improve physical fitness, including:
                Exercise Frequency: The number of times a person should exercise for more than a week.
                Exercise intensity control: The target heart rate should be reached when performing the exercise. 
                The maximum rate depends on the age, as subtracted from 220, the maximum number of heartbeats is 220 minus 50, or 170 beats per minute for a 50-year-old. 
                The goal is to reach 50% - 85% of this rate. This can be determined by monitoring the ease and difficulty of each exercise. If the exercise is easy, the intensity should be increased to suit the person.
                Optimal Exercise Time: Exercise time should be more than usual. If you want to lose weight or meet specific fitness goals, you may need to do more exercise.
                Change Exercise Type: Exercises should be changed from time to time. If a person is constantly walking, he can move on to jogging, then jogging, or move to another exercise altogether, such as swimming.
